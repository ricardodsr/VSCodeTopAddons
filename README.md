# Auto Close Tag
        The Auto Close tag extension automatically closes any tag. It looks simple but saves a lot of time by reducing the bug of not closing ending tags. This extension works in HTML, XML, React, and other Frameworks.
        
# Auto Rename Tag
        As the name implies, it aids in renaming tags. This saves time when renaming tags in a nested codebase and also helps in preventing future runtime bugs.
