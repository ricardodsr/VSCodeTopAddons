# Github Copilot
    The Github Copilot is among the trending VsCode extensions this year. 
    It makes real-time code and function suggestions directly on your code editor using an OpenAI Codex. GitHub Copilot generates coding suggestions in dozens of languages using natural language cues like comments and method names after being trained on billions of lines of public code.
  
# Auto Close Tag
    The Auto Close tag extension automatically closes any tag. 
    It looks simple but saves a lot of time by reducing the bug of not closing ending tags. 
    This extension works in HTML, XML, React, and other Frameworks.
        
# Auto Rename Tag
    As the name implies, it aids in renaming tags. 
    This saves time when renaming tags in a nested codebase and also helps in preventing future runtime bugs.

# Better Comments
    This Better Comments extension gives a colorful comment when used in a code block, attracting developersâ€™ attention. 
    This helps more when working in a team or collaboration.

# CodeSnap
    The CodeSnap extension helps in taking cool code screenshots. 
    This helps a lot when trying to ask questions or answer questions on sites like Stackoverflow and on sites where pasting a code snippet would turn messy.

# ESLint
    The ESLint extension serves as a code validator. 
    It runs through your code to check for syntax errors, underlines them, and suggests possible solutions to fix and improve them. 
    The ESLint extension also has many configurations to improve the code integrity, such as rules and styles. 

# GitLens
    GitLens is a git tracker that watches the entire code and keeps track of:
    Which part of the code was updated or pushed.
    when it was pushed.
    who pushed it, what was pushed.
    Overall changes made.

# Live Server
    This extension opens your project in your default web browser using a port. It refreshes your page on saving, eliminating the stress of reloading, thus boosting productivity.

# Path Intellisense
    The Path Intellisense plugin auto-completes filenames and file paths in our code. This reduces the stress of reciting import paths and file names.

# Remote - SSH
    The Remote - SSH extension lets you use any remote machine with an SSH server as your development environment. This makes it much easier to develop and/or troubleshoot in a wide variety of scenarios.

# Git History
    Similar to GitLens, Git History is a VSCode extension that gives a visual of the git log. No longer should you look through git log in the terminal.

# Backbox
    Step1: Start the line with "//"

    Step2: Write your question for example: "//how to get the stock data of Tesla in python?"

    Step3: Once you press the "?" question mark, Blackbox will return the code snippet

    Step4: Press Tab to keep the suggested code snippet
